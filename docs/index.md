# Welcome to NHBSystems

Right now, this site is just to host documentation for the products I
currently sell on Tindie. These are circuit boards I've designed to solve problems
I've encountered in the world of mechanical testing instrumentation, and civil 
infrastructure monitoring. I make and sell these in the hope that they may solve
other peoples problems as well. I also hope to share related information that others 
may find useful.
